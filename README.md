# Data Analysis in Fisheries Science

There are 6 students doing their final-year project at the University of York on Data Analysis in Fisheries Science:

-   [Chloe Hodson](https://github.com/ChloeH276/Third-Year-Project)
-   [Jacob Passfield](https://github.com/jacobpassfield/third-year-project)
-   [Maisie Beckett](https://github.com/maisiebeckett/3rd-year-project)
-   [Scott Connors](https://github.com/Scott-Connors/3rd-Year-Project)
-   [Tallulah Coyte](https://github.com/tallulahcoyte/3rd-Year-Project)
-   [Felix Carter](https://github.com/Felix-C577/Third-Year-Project)

They are supervised by [Gustav Delius](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/gustav-delius/) except for Felix who is supervised by [Jon Pitchford](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/jon-pitchford/).

We will interact as a group via this GitHub repository. In particular, we will use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gustavdelius/fisheries-data-analysis/issues) as our discussion forum where students can ask questions or share helpful information.
